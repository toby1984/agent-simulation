# Agents

This is a very crude multi-agent simulation environment.

The agents (aka 'robots') task is to deliver items between factories and depots. Each robot is assigned to exactly one controller while each factory/depot is serviced by all controllers it is within range.

Controllers have a finite communication range and robots assigned to a controller cannot move beyond its communication range.
